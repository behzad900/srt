1
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:27,089
Dear Santa, are you real?

2
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,199
If you live at the North Pole...

3
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,564
...how come I can't see your house
when I look on Google Earth?

4
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,097
Are you Saint Nicholas?

5
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,742
Because you'd be incredibly old.

6
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,401
How do you have time
to read all the letters...

7
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,569
...from all the children in the world?

8
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:48,185
And how many cookies and mince pies
have you eaten in all of history?

9
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,514
How do you get all the presents
in the sack?

10
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:54,021
Does your sack have to
get bigger every year...

11
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,024
...because of exponential
population growth?

12
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,424
And how do you get down
the chimneys?

13
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:02,088
I put my head in ours
and it's really small.

14
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:04,700
Even if you could squeeze down it
in one minute...

15
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,929
...there's nine houses in my road
so that's nearly 10 minutes.

16
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,631
And there are millions of roads
in the world.

17
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:14,403
It must be so hard being Santa
these days.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,748
I mean, what if after all of that,
I'm staying at Grandma's?

19
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:23,944
Santa, how can you get round
the whole world in just one night?

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,088
My friend said...

21
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,053
...that you'd have to go so fast...

22
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:31,992
...it would make you and the sleigh
and the reindeer all burn up.

23
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:36,122
I think you are real.
But how do you do it?

24
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:41,169
For Christmas I would love
a pink Twinkle Bike with stabilizers.

25
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,298
But please don't bring it
if it makes you and the reindeer burn.

26
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:50,912
Love, Gwen Hines. 23 Mimosa Avenue,
Trelew, Cornwall, England.

27
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,616
Dear Gwen,
thank you for your letter...

28
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,845
...and brilliant picture.

29
00:02:57,042 --> 00:03:01,752
Your request for a pink Twinkle Bike
will be passed on to Santa.

30
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:04,656
And, yes, do believe in Santa.

31
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:07,321
He is real.

32
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,100
He's the greatest man ever.

33
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:13,264
And he can get around the world
to every child...

34
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,099
without a single reindeer
being roasted ali--

35
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,134
Hun.

36
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:23,374
By the time the sun comes up
on Christmas Day, he'll get to you too...

37
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,104
...using his...

38
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,013
...special magic.

39
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,280
First Field Elf Battalion, set.

40
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,045
- Straighten that teddy bear, soldier.
- Ma'am.

41
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,120
That's a:

42
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,125
"Ho, ho, ho" Aarhus.

43
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:50,530
Field elves, jingle! Drop time,
18.14 seconds per household.

44
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,904
Left foot, sir. Right foot, sir.

45
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,040
That's it, that's it.

46
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:07,982
Dog food incoming.

47
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:09,550
Meaty chunks in the hole.

48
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,125
Wow, a grand piano. This kid
must have been good his whole life.

49
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,915
Marvelous. Gets me every time.

50
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,256
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

51
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:56,598
Merry--

52
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,304
Carrot chomped.

53
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,881
- Sir?
- Goodness me.

54
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,183
Sony.

55
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,884
Drop complete. Stand by, S-1.

56
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,689
- You're gonna make it, soldier.
- Aarhus is merry.

57
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,297
Santa has left the building.

58
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,608
North Pole to S-1, you have weather...

59
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,372
...fluctuation. Update camouflage.

60
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:20,016
Roger that, Control.

61
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,047
Hull projection...

62
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,446
-...optimized.
- Roger, S-1.

63
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,746
Denmark cleared.

64
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:27,049
Next drop, Flensburg,
minus 12.4 seconds.

65
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,022
Flensburg weather:

66
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,426
Deep, crisp, even.

67
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,084
- Making a list.
- Check it twice.

68
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,924
- Checking twice.
- A wrap for Denmark.

69
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,260
- Converting milk and cookies to biofuel.
- Hello?

70
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,262
- Santa on bridge.
- Sony.

71
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,407
Forgot the PIN code.

72
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,474
Just crossed into Germany, sir.

73
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:47,870
Germany.

74
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,536
- So many countries these days.
- It's a big night, sir.

75
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,448
My 70th mission. Yes.

76
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:55,710
Oh, sorry.

77
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,377
One too many mince pies.

78
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,250
Looking forward to it? Retirement?

79
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,054
Ten seconds to Flensburg.

80
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,889
Maintain current...

81
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,989
- Carly on.
- Update national protocol.

82
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:12,135
Delete rice pudding and carrot.
German leave-out for Santa...

83
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,397
...is shoe on front step.
Repeat, shoe on step.

84
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,840
-6OOAM3.
- Gift secured.

85
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,136
Oi, soldier. Get off your baubles.

86
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,076
What happened to peace and goodwill
to all men, sarge?

87
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,739
It don't say nothing about elves, soldier.
Go, go, go!

88
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,077
Engage rooftops.

89
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,082
It's snow time!

90
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:33,655
S-1, hold drop altitude.

91
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:34,950
This is Germany, Father.

92
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,890
Drive on the right.
National dish: sausage.

93
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:43,157
Okay, let's show them, people.
Operation Santa Claus is coming to town.

94
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,017
- Drop complete.
- Drop complete.

95
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,880
- Drop complete.
- Drop complete.

96
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,180
- Drop complete.
- Drop complete.

97
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,854
Operational efficiency:

98
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:14,861
- One hundred percent.
- Hold the handrail.

99
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,363
Dear, I'm sorry.

100
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,524
Thanks. Brendon Doherty.

101
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,226
Ruby Miller. That's Grace Smith.

102
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:21,233
She wants...

103
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,337
-...an elephant.
- What are you doing here?

104
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,475
Got to get this letter
from Maria Costa...

105
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,371
...to Steve.

106
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,203
Oh, no! Maria!

107
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:28,970
Bye-bye, Maria.

108
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,174
Is this yours, Arthur?

109
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:32,474
Oh, thanks, Kenneth.

110
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,810
- Merry Christmas.
- Want...

111
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:34,712
...a ride?

112
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:35,715
Doubt it.

113
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:37,214
No, thanks. I'm not...

114
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,049
very good with heights, speed...

115
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:39,985
...and that thing!

116
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:42,682
- Buckle down, people.
- Buckle down.

117
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,020
- Peter.
- Ready, sir.

118
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,890
SITREP on special forces.

119
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,655
- Where are they?
- America, sir.

120
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,493
White House.
Delivering to the president's children, sir.

121
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,762
Okay. Left out of the Oval Office,
right at the Cabinet Room...

122
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:54,994
...via the air vents.

123
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,935
You think of everything, sir.

124
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,268
Thank you, Peter. I'd love an espresso.

125
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,465
Coming right up.

126
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,912
Beg your pardon. Well done!

127
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:04,342
Merry Christmas.

128
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,949
- Wow, brilliant.
- Mind the glasses.

129
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,175
Keep up, everybody.

130
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,114
- Arthur.
- Sorry. Can I just--?

131
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,218
No, never mind.

132
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,412
Do you mind if I--?

133
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,250
Oh, dear.

134
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,084
I'm so sorry.

135
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,386
.55..
- Merry Christmas.

136
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,291
- FRC--
- And a happy New Year.

137
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:23,359
What a night, sir.

138
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:27,601
Out with the old Santa,
in with the new, eh?

139
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,540
Let's focus on the now, eh, Peter?

140
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,538
Support teams...

141
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,472
-...prep Poland.
- Poland.

142
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,407
Poland. Do you know what they call...

143
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:36,773
...Dad here?

144
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,582
Anyway...

145
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:44,880
I guess he's harmless.

146
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,146
I'm terribly sorry.

147
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:49,121
Is that your leg?

148
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:52,960
I'm sorry!

149
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:57,392
I'm really sorry.
It's my Christmas slippers on the ice.

150
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,635
They're from China.

151
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,770
- Found it.
- What?

152
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,167
The letter. The one I said.

153
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:04,636
From Maria Costa.

154
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:07,606
She asked for a Pocket-Puppy,
but she wants the blue one.

155
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:10,178
It looks like her auntie's dog,
Biffo, that ran away.

156
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:11,814
I remember because she sent...

157
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,244
...a picture of Biffo. See?

158
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:14,975
- Child CG786K'?
- Look, Arthur...

159
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,286
This was Greece, sir.

160
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,046
Five countries ago, sir.

161
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,152
I just want it to be perfect
for every kid.

162
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,661
Hey, there's Dad. Santa!

163
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:31,323
Maria Costa, Dad.
Did she get the blue one?!

164
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,697
Little bro, it's great to have you around.

165
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:38,968
You bring a genuine aura
of seasonal positivity.

166
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:39,835
Thanks, Steve.

167
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:43,673
But could you not be
in Mission Control...

168
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:46,941
...at all for the rest of the night?

169
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,349
Yeah.

170
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:52,953
- All right?
- I'll never walk...

171
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,148
-...again.
- Of course.

172
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,586
Right.

173
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,590
Sorry if I...

174
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,590
Brilliant.

175
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:02,788
They should put him...

176
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:05,901
-...somewhere out of harm's way.
- What, like the South Pole?

177
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,331
Waker!

178
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,729
We have a waker!

179
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,106
And Santa's in there!

180
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,506
Code red.

181
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,705
Repeat: code red.

182
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,692
Santa? Are you here?

183
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:38,594
Steve?

184
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,861
Hold on, Father.

185
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,265
Intel! Get me Intel!

186
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,064
Santa's head seems to be resting...

187
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,731
...on some son of "try me" button, sir.

188
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,642
It's the Quack Quack Moo
Activity Farm, sir.

189
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,678
It features 12 separate animal sounds.

190
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,374
- Sings "Old MacDonald Had A Farm."
- The moment...

191
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,248
...your father lifts his head, there'll be
10 seconds of constant mooing.

192
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,786
Risk of mooing: 98 percent.

193
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,583
Captain Marino...

194
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,852
...you'll have to take the batteries out.

195
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:05,085
He'd have to get past...

196
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,857
...the wrapping, the box and 14 twist ties
anchoring it to the cardboard.

197
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,032
It's too noisy!

198
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,031
It'll wake the boy! He'll see Santa!

199
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,204
Remember 1816...

200
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,862
...when Santa was seen.
They tracked him home.

201
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,234
He had to go into hiding.

202
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:23,073
No Christmas for six years.
The elves all alone!

203
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,043
The elves alone!

204
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:27,406
Calm, people!

205
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,449
It's not 1816 now.

206
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:32,746
Marino, your HOHO
is equipped with state-of-the-art...

207
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:36,484
EMF sensor technology hacked directly
from the military's missile program.

208
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,422
I want you to locate the batteries...

209
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,189
...and perform a Level 3
giftwrap incision.

210
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,065
Go in through the robin.

211
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,233
Incising robin.

212
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,139
Big girl's blouse.

213
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,406
Lot of fuss.

214
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,481
I did my 70 missions...

215
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,812
...without any of this malarkey.

216
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:04,513
Didn't we, lad?

217
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,951
- Twist ties clear.
- Can I watch with you, Grandsanta?

218
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,183
Shut the door!

219
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:10,417
Hell's berries...

220
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:13,791
-...it's the North Pole!
- Kid still asleep? He mustn't see Santa.

221
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:16,296
- Dad would rather die than spoil it.
- What if you...

222
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,025
...wake the odd nipper? A whack...

223
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:20,635
...with a sock of sand,
dab of whiskey on the lips...

224
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,328
...they don't remember.

225
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,298
- Screwdriver elf.
- Yes!

226
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,205
What happened...

227
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,539
...to going down the "chimbley"?
Never did me any har--

228
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,705
Get off me!

229
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,145
You smell like a wet elf.

230
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,115
Goodness! Down, boy! Basket.

231
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:37,651
Here you are, Grandsanta.

232
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,652
I've made you a nice mince pie.

233
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,620
I can't eat that. It gets in me teeth.

234
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,724
Oh, dear.

235
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,019
Now I've got to visit...

236
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:44,956
...the elf hospital...

237
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:47,687
...look over a treaty with Greenland
and make the gravy.

238
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,959
Then we'll finally have
the whole family home for Christmas.

239
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:52,362
They're nearly done!

240
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:55,298
- Battery clear.
- Oh, no.

241
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,164
It's the detachable milk maid!

242
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,639
- She's got her own power source!
- Five seconds...

243
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:02,805
...till she starts singing!

244
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,504
Four!

245
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:07,644
Three!

246
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,910
Two !

247
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,018
One!

248
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,485
Use your HOHO. Exit...

249
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:14,988
...code 12. Code 12!

250
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,069
Okay, go, go, go!

251
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:31,400
Revise drop time to 14.13 seconds.

252
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,940
Let's pick this up, people!

253
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:33,769
Drop time...

254
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,434
...revised. Picking this up...

255
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,578
---People.

256
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,839
Everybody, mission...

257
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,038
...re-engage.

258
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:44,918
Three...

259
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:45,918
...two...

260
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:46,919
...one!

261
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:50,123
Mission accomplished.

262
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,254
Hey!

263
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,935
Oh, what a night that was.

264
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,901
That detachable milk maid thing.

265
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:05,974
This is just the beginning,
right, sir?

266
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,401
I got you a present, sir.

267
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,940
Not S for Steve, sir.

268
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:13,712
S for Santa.

269
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,977
Oh, I don't know about that, Peter.
Okay...

270
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:19,882
...let's bring them home.

271
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,750
CCTV...

272
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,916
...in every room!
Had to go under the floor!

273
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,030
- Sarah.
- Back! Holly injury coming through!

274
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,165
Hey, fancy...

275
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:04,823
a trip on the S-1 , Arthur?

276
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,594
It only goes 150,000...

277
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,499
-...miles an hour.
- No, no. Thanks.

278
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,833
I see a bit of the world in my office,
you know.

279
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,806
Some of the stamps I get
are amazing.

280
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,141
Excuse me.

281
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,344
Santa!

282
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,545
Dad!

283
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,478
Dad! Dad!

284
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,516
I'm sorry. So sorry. Dad!

285
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:23,717
Dad!

286
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,512
- Santa's waving!
- He's waving at me!

287
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,020
- He's waving at me!
- At me!

288
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:28,179
Dad!

289
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:30,954
Arthur.

290
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,652
Happy Christmas.

291
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,492
You too.

292
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,462
You were fantastic!

293
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,962
Look! Christmas slippers.

294
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,836
Well done. Yes.

295
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:45,702
Father?

296
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,977
There he is. Steve!

297
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:56,179
Mission accomplished!

298
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,180
Tonight we delivered...

299
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,326
...2 billion presents.

300
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,995
On this...

301
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,653
...my 70th mission!

302
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:11,497
We'll miss you, Santa!

303
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:12,361
Stand by.

304
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,571
Oh, thank you.

305
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:20,038
You know, I sometimes think
I couldn't do it without you.

306
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,000
And my splendid...

307
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,614
...Margaret, who's stood by me
all these years...

308
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,216
very ably doing all that...

309
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:29,508
...stuff...

310
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:32,177
...that women do when
their husbands work. Marvelous.

311
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,258
And Arthur, yes, doing...

312
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,416
...vital work in Maintenance,
really vital.

313
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,926
I...l work...

314
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:40,790
...in Letters.

315
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:44,125
- Letters, of course. I'm so sorry.
- You moved me...

316
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,532
...after I tripped over that plug
and melted down the elf barracks.

317
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:48,932
I lost everything in that flood!

318
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,139
Yes. Now...

319
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:56,277
...many years ago, my father told me...

320
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:02,049
...that being Santa
is the best job in the world.

321
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,143
He was right.

322
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,050
I've loved it.

323
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:12,656
I can't wait for year 71!

324
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,825
Merry Christmas, everyone.

325
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,810
He's red, he's white!
He's worked all through the night!

326
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,612
Santa!

327
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,461
"What do you get
if you eat Christmas decorations?

328
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,568
Tinselitis!"

329
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,870
Isn't this the best bit of Christmas?

330
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:11,950
It certainly is, Arthur.
The whole family together.

331
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,454
How about a toast, Malcolm?

332
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,185
Well, here's to me doing
an even better job next year.

333
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,829
- Next year.
- But you're...

334
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:24,626
-...already perfect, Dad.
- That turkey did more than him.

335
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,836
You wouldn't understand, Father.

336
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,166
I've rather moved things on
since your day. Eh, Steve?

337
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,076
Forget Techno Tommy. He's texting
on his calculator after another job.

338
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,212
It's a Handheld...

339
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,542
...Operational and Homing Organizer.
The HOHO 3000.

340
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,212
I'm enacting mission closure.

341
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:47,354
Aren't you the fancy nancy?
Don't matter what you come up with.

342
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,824
You may be next in line, but you'll never
get to be Santa unless you knock him off.

343
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,630
I've got you all a present.

344
00:20:56,821 --> 00:21:01,531
After all the hard work, I wanted everyone
to have some Christmas fun.

345
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,761
- I'm Santa!
- No, no, I'm Santa. It's ridiculous.

346
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,592
- You just took the piece out of my hand.
- Well, I am actually Santa...

347
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,290
...so I think I should have it.

348
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,266
- Yes. You're the nonexecutive figurehead.
- Exactly.

349
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,563
- Figurehead.
- It means...

350
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,866
...a fatty with a beard who fits the suit.

351
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,065
The other pieces are good too.

352
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:42,268
Or I can make extra Santas
for everyone.

353
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,972
Why don't you be the candle, Steve?

354
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:47,314
All those bright ideas, eh?

355
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,885
Fine. I'm the candle
Arthur's the turkey"...

356
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,546
...and you, Father,
are, of course, Santa.

357
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:57,124
Grandsanta, you can be
this charming relic.

358
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,228
"Relic"? "Relic"?

359
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,955
I did the whole of Christmas
in one of these, Arthur.

360
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,431
Oh, yes. I didn't need
a trillion elves in bleepy hats.

361
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,625
We don't fly about...

362
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,499
...throwing lead-painted toys
down chimneys anymore.

363
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:11,002
That space sends you back...

364
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:13,971
-...to Lapland.
- Malcolm, where did you get those?

365
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,669
Just moving things along. Do I win?

366
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,404
Cheats, the pair of you!

367
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:19,741
Mum, are you okay?

368
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,818
Polar bear, dear. Attacked me on the ice
Good I did that online survival course...

369
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,581
-...or there'd be one less for turkey.
- Christmas has...

370
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:30,248
...gone right down the rodney hole.
You're a postman with a spaceship.

371
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:35,930
My S-1 festivized the world
at 1860 times the speed of sound.

372
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:38,624
Christmas 1941, World War II...

373
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,498
...did the whole thing with
six reindeer and a drunken elf!

374
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,195
I was shot at, Arthur.

375
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,637
Took 12 direct hits.
Lost three reindeer.

376
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,468
What happened...

377
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,872
-...to the elf?
- Fell out of the sleigh over Lake Geneva.

378
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:49,977
Never saw him again.

379
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,306
Goodness. Now...

380
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:55,042
"Christmas crackers.
Sing 'Silent Night' backwards."

381
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,775
Who'd know that?

382
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,121
I went on alone.

383
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:07,229
I could still do it now, Arthur.
Just give me a go!

384
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,626
- In a heap of sticks.
-"Heap of--"?

385
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:10,993
Let me up and at him!

386
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:13,567
I'll show you, Robby the Robot!

387
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,771
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

388
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,005
I'll have that back.

389
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:18,902
- Would have won anyway.
- What?

390
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,837
Oh, yeah. Run away...

391
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,535
...now you're losing!

392
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:27,308
Steve!

393
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:29,917
Steve.

394
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:31,280
Don't be upset. Look.

395
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:32,547
You keep this.

396
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,551
Then you can be Santa next time.

397
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:39,525
That'll be you there, Steve.

398
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,256
Next year...

399
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,397
...I bet.

400
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:44,357
You'll be great.

401
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,564
How many times, Arthur?

402
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:51,798
It's the North Pole. Shut the doors.

403
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:55,841
I secured the gift.

404
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,071
- Gift secured!
- Just can't be.

405
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,579
The system is foolproof.

406
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,045
It has to be an error, sir.

407
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:02,081
"Error"?

408
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,377
I spotted the ribbon
glinting in the shadows.

409
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:05,617
I am actually...

410
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,880
...trained in wrapping.

411
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:11,289
And I said to myself, "Bryony, the
wrapping looks okay. Thank goodness.

412
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,827
But that present should not
be lying in the--"

413
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:15,759
- Thank you, soldier.
- Has someone...

414
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,900
...got the wrong present? That's awful.

415
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,091
- Whose is it?
- No one...

416
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,201
...gets the wrong...

417
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,962
...present. 47785...

418
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,730
...BXK...

419
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,272
"Gift undelivered"?

420
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,137
They got nothing?

421
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:28,369
A child's...

422
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,603
...been missed!

423
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,644
Not necessarily.

424
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:35,876
A child's been missed!

425
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,485
Wanna wake up the North Pole?

426
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,121
Good idea. A child's...

427
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,483
-...been missed!
- Arthur!

428
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:43,248
Everything all right?

429
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:44,791
There's been a glitch.

430
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,327
"A glitch"? We've missed a child!

431
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,624
Really? Dear, oh, dear.

432
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:50,663
That's awful.

433
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:52,425
How did you let it happen, Steven?

434
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,570
How did I--?
I thought it was your mission.

435
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:57,001
- No. This is your department.
- What'll we do?

436
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,573
We must-- We must--

437
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,976
- What must we do, Steven?
- There's nothing to do.

438
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,772
The mission was a success.

439
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,381
We can't leave a child
out of Christmas.

440
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:08,644
Sunrise at destination...

441
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,650
...is 7:39 a.m. There's no way
to get there in time.

442
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:13,311
Except, of course, for the S-1 .

443
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,515
- The S-1. Right-o.
- No! The S-1

444
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,921
has just traveled 7 million miles.

445
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,152
We could damage it.

446
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,421
Oh, dear.

447
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,660
- And risk the lives of the elves.
- Oh, my. No.

448
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:25,129
LII go I s in

449
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:26,529
Bryony Shelfley...

450
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,693
...Wrapping Division. Grade 3, sir.

451
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,600
- Who asked you?
- I wasn't called up for field duty.

452
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,867
I served out my mission
in Gift Wrap Support.

453
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:37,478
I wrapped 264,000 presents
in three days, sir.

454
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,340
If you want that bike delivered...

455
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,847
...in a perfect state...

456
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:42,678
...of enwrapment, then I'm your elf.

457
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,217
No one is going.

458
00:25:44,408 --> 00:25:45,216
It's impossible.

459
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:46,649
- But this child--
- It's a...

460
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:52,159
...margin of error
of 0.00000001514834 percent...

461
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:54,159
...sir.

462
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:55,862
I mean, hello?

463
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,124
Where's the champagne?

464
00:25:57,288 --> 00:26:01,964
My department has delivered
the most outstanding Christmas ever.

465
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:05,634
Well done, us.

466
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:08,072
But there's a child without a present.

467
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,802
Arthur, Christmas is not a time
for emotion.

468
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:14,040
We will get 47785BXK a present...

469
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,412
...within the window of Christmas.

470
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,077
We'll messenger the item.
It'll be there in five days.

471
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:21,245
But that'll ruin the magic.

472
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,059
If there was any way at all
to make the drop tonight...

473
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,423
But it can't be done.

474
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,656
Your brother...

475
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,164
...knows about these things.

476
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:36,703
I won't sleep easy after this, Arthur,
but there it is.

477
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,534
Can't be done.

478
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:42,207
Merry Christmas.

479
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,443
Arthur! You're compromising...

480
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,246
...the wrapping! That is not...

481
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,117
...a toy! Well, it is...

482
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:55,689
...but, I mean, that's not--

483
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,915
Arthur!

484
00:26:58,082 --> 00:26:59,117
Oh, come on, come on...

485
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:02,787
...come on. Child 47785BXK...

486
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,499
...where are you?

487
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,770
"Dear Santa, my friend
doesn't believe in you.

488
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:11,998
For Christmas I'd like
a pink Twinkle Bike.

489
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,242
Gwen Hines.

490
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:19,279
23 Mimosa Avenue,
Trelew, Cornwall, England."

491
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,904
Lights out.

492
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:48,900
This figurehead thingy:

493
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:52,004
I'm not just a fatty with a suit, am I'?

494
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:54,513
Of course not, dear.

495
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,448
No. I'm Santa.

496
00:27:57,608 --> 00:27:58,951
Children...

497
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:01,620
...rely on me.

498
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:05,185
Here.

499
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:09,161
Thank you. It's just checks
for the boys and cash for Father.

500
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,663
Oh, Malcolm.

501
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:14,462
It's the 2 billion other gifts, dear.
Christmas has become...

502
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,660
...such a mad rush.

503
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:18,432
Until you retire.

504
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,333
Retire?

505
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:24,178
Sit next to Father,
watching Steve on TV?

506
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,315
You are sitting on
a level one access HOHO.

507
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,451
Please state your identity.
State your identity.

508
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:32,376
Who would I be?

509
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:35,717
You'd be my Malcolm, dear.

510
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,353
And there's Arthur.

511
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:40,118
Dear Arthur.

512
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,525
- What a puzzle.
- This one's for me, dear.

513
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:46,958
Happy Christmas, Margaret.

514
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:48,159
Oh, thank you.

515
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm still very much up to the job,
you know.

516
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:55,700
Good night, dear.

517
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,639
Good night, Malcolm.

518
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,547
It just can't be. It can't.

519
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:08,554
- It just can't be. It can't. It just can't be!
- What's all this...

520
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,748
...kadoodle, young man?

521
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,654
Grandsanta.

522
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:11,589
This little girl.

523
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:13,194
She's been missed!

524
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,389
So much for your brother's
fancy-pants technology.

525
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,262
Steve and Dad racked their brains
but said it's impossible.

526
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:20,595
Is it, now?

527
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:24,535
Missed a child. Dear, oh dear,
sends shivers down me shins.

528
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:26,902
In two hours, she's gonna wake up...

529
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:30,568
...tear downstairs,
search under the tree...

530
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:34,447
...and the look on her face...

531
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:38,246
But there's nothing there.

532
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,220
She won't understand. She'll think
she's the one kid in the world...

533
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,917
...that Santa doesn't care about.

534
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:46,956
She'll feel so...

535
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,597
...left out.

536
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,769
On Christmas night, he comes.

537
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:58,600
Gwen can't not have a present
from Santa.

538
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,607
Do you know, Arthur, there is a way.

539
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,404
It's impossible.

540
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,980
They used to say it was impossible
to teach women to read.

541
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:08,946
Follow me.

542
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,078
It's the actual sleigh.

543
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:46,986
Hello, Evie.

544
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:48,817
I thought it was scrapped years ago.

545
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:50,754
So did everyone else.

546
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:52,018
Can I--?

547
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:58,166
Icelandic birch. Arctic balsa.
Built in 1845.

548
00:30:58,322 --> 00:31:02,998
Able to reach 50,000 miles per hour
at a height of 40,000 feet.

549
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,231
Over here, you string of tinsel.

550
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,165
Got it.

551
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,000
"Potash of carboniloroxy...

552
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,878
...amilocitrate."

553
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:13,477
Magic dust.

554
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,447
Mined from the aurora borealis.

555
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:21,251
But she doesn't still go?

556
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:26,985
Not just a hobby, Arthur.

557
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:31,865
Great-great-grandchildren
of the original eight.

558
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:41,273
Dasher.

559
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:45,811
Dancer.

560
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:47,481
Prancer.

561
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:52,678
What are the others called? I could
never ruddy remember. Bambi? John.

562
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:53,844
You there, with the...

563
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,183
...white ear. And you.

564
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,225
And-- Not you, you bag of fleas.

565
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,517
Arthur?

566
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:02,091
I'm not really good with big animals.

567
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,321
Piffle!

568
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:06,297
Don't get bit, mind.
They can smell fear.

569
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,437
- Let's hitch them up.
- Oh, Grandsanta.

570
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,097
Excuse me.

571
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,576
You can go to Gwen!

572
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,737
On the old sleigh, with the reindeer
and the magic dust and everything!

573
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,109
It's a miracle.

574
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:22,208
You're coming too, lad.

575
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,348
Me?

576
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:28,081
On that? Up there? Pulled by them?

577
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:30,590
No. No way.

578
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:35,219
I'm 136. I can't do it on me own,
I need an elf.

579
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:40,028
I can't fly a sleigh. I can't even
ride a bike without stabilizers.

580
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,726
I know, let's wake Steve. He'll--

581
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:42,927
No.

582
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:47,872
He's a worrier, Arthur. What if
he stops us? Gwen's forgotten.

583
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,370
- You really care.
- Well, of course...

584
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:54,072
...I do. I was Santa too.

585
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,111
Think of your dad...

586
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:58,912
...lying awake, chewing his...

587
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,613
...beard off with worry over this girl.

588
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,282
Don't you want to help for once?

589
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:06,655
Make him proud?

590
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,588
I can't.

591
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,727
I just-- I can't.

592
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,267
No, I can't.

593
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:31,845
Ready?!

594
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,251
No! You promise...

595
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:37,016
...not to go too fast?

596
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,286
Or high.

597
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:43,095
Or bumpy. I get travel sick.
I'm allergic to snow.

598
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:45,995
Ye baubles. And you a son of Santa?

599
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:53,300
Wait! My slippers!
They're not for outdoor use!

600
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,273
Dash! Dash!

601
00:33:58,502 --> 00:33:59,537
Dash!

602
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,316
See?

603
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,048
Who's Santa now?

604
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,955
Put me down!

605
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,999
- What's the matter, boy?
- I'm having...

606
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:21,534
...a heart attack.

607
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,363
They've never flown before.

608
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:28,474
Just gotta break them in.

609
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:29,975
Now...

610
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,352
Come away!

611
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,987
Dash away!

612
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,667
Look, Arthur. All those stars.

613
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,362
We're one of them now.

614
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,269
A shooting star!

615
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:04,712
Stuck that there for your dad
when he was a boy.

616
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,939
Dad? What, he sat here?

617
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:08,378
So did I.

618
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,918
Every young heir to the Pole
gets took out by his father.

619
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,080
Right back to Saint Nick.

620
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:18,456
We Clauses used to be the only men...

621
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:21,186
...in the world who could fly, Arthur...

622
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:22,955
...and see all this.

623
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,502
It was a gift, a great big ball
wrapped in oceans and mountains.

624
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,506
I remember the look on your father's face
when he saw it.

625
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,310
Fish!

626
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,943
With horns!

627
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:16,984
Want to help me make a snowman?

628
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:17,915
No! Not ye--!

629
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,848
Oh, where's the seat belt?

630
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:38,269
Could Dad do that?
Did he make a snowman for Steve?

631
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:39,805
Robot Roy?

632
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,302
I should cocoa.

633
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,309
The next Santa, and he's
never even sat in a sleigh.

634
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:45,640
Oi!

635
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:50,111
- Is that...?
- The map of the Clauses.

636
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,082
Used every Christmas night in history.

637
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:55,846
Whatever your brother says, Arthur...

638
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,687
...it's the same old world.

639
00:37:04,354 --> 00:37:05,162
What is it?!

640
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:06,392
No idea. I've never...

641
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,625
...seen it before.

642
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:09,202
- It's a city!
- A new one?

643
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,066
Ruddy cheek.
They're always putting...

644
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:11,899
...these things up.

645
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:14,074
I remember the first time...

646
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:16,233
...I ran into Chicago.

647
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,708
Chicago wasn't on the map?

648
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,648
Now, where are we?

649
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:22,840
Here we are, see?

650
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,042
Oh, no, that's Peking.

651
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:26,486
Ahead, there's a--!

652
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,423
They can see us.

653
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:33,051
Well, pull the camouflage lever.

654
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,922
Now, then, we'd better...

655
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:36,153
...draw in a few...

656
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,526
...skyscratchers. Just...

657
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,230
Not that one.

658
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:42,427
That's a steam train, you ninny.

659
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:43,263
Do this one.

660
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:46,264
So, what do they call this place?

661
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,173
"Toronto."

662
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,574
Toronto's in Canada.

663
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:53,908
The Santas always
come through Canada.

664
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:56,449
Nobody lives here.

665
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,550
It's nice and quiet.

666
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:01,122
Till your brother came with...

667
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:04,191
...his "You can't cut through Saigon,
there's a war" rubbish.

668
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,850
Don't need him to tell me
what's ahead.

669
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:07,086
- I got eyes.
- Grandsanta!

670
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,591
Ye baubles, an elf.

671
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:16,465
Bryony Shelfley. There's...

672
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,367
...a small trauma to your giftwrap...

673
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:19,734
...but I can fix it.

674
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,535
- A stowaway!
- I can wrap anything...

675
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,611
...sir, with three bits of sticky tape.
Three!

676
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,406
Good. Wrap yourself a parachute.

677
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,412
Grandsanta!

678
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:43,221
Toronto. Present and correct.

679
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,994
Not quite, sir. You've lost
one of the reindeer.

680
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:58,843
Hello?

681
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:00,913
- What elf?
- Bryony Shelfley, sir.

682
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:02,948
The crazy wrapping elf, you know?

683
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:07,350
Security tracked her to Sector 19.
And we think Arthur was here.

684
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,785
Arthur?

685
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,789
Who else leaves the door open,
huh, sir?

686
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,759
The old sleigh barn?
That was sealed up...

687
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:14,952
...decades ago...

688
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:18,793
...after that terrible night
Grandsanta sneaked out and...

689
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,925
Thank goodness he's too old these days
to get into trouble.

690
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,739
Bash it with a brick, Arthur. Go on.

691
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,676
It just won't--

692
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:32,975
Grab its antlers and tug.

693
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:36,709
I may just be a wrapping operative,
sir, but this contravenes...

694
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,945
- Seventeen.
- Specific mission regulations.

695
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,556
I'm in charge here,
not Billy the Bureaucrat.

696
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:43,724
It's stuck.

697
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:48,656
Eighteen.

698
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,156
- Elf, wrap your head.
- Sir!

699
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:53,198
Come on, lad. You're as much use...

700
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,700
...as a cheese chopstick.

701
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:56,997
Got it!

702
00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:58,795
Oh, no.

703
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,874
Oh, my big Aunt Betty.

704
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:05,046
It'll have to do. Pass it down.

705
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,044
What?

706
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,515
Permission to breathe, sir. I have about
nine seconds left before I black out.

707
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,510
One breath.

708
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:14,886
Sir?

709
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,184
I said one. Hurry up, Arthur.

710
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:20,393
But don't we need a whole one?

711
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,927
You know...

712
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:23,530
...to balance the sleigh?

713
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,725
Oh, it won't balance the sleigh. No, no.
If anything, it'll slow us down.

714
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,001
So why are we taking it?

715
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:36,007
It's for Gwen. Eight beautiful reindeer.
That's what she's dreaming of.

716
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:38,305
The jingly bells, the sleigh on the roof.

717
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,539
- Yeah, but--
- That's what the kids want...

718
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,877
...not some spaceship.

719
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,281
We're giving her the star treatment.

720
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:46,512
What now?

721
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,015
We have a waker, sir.

722
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,249
With a gun!

723
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:52,725
That's it, lad.

724
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:53,691
You distract him!

725
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,352
- Grandsanta!
- Who's there?

726
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,698
We come in peace.

727
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,529
Our craft has to...

728
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:05,969
...travel around the world
in less than an hour!

729
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,636
We need a sign for our slei--

730
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:13,612
Craft.

731
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:16,608
Sony I can't pay you. Where I...

732
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:17,808
...come from, we don't have...

733
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:19,578
...money!

734
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,459
Christmas 1923...

735
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:37,332
...had a heart attack at the reins.
Left ventricle popped out me mouth.

736
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,496
Pushed it back down and carried on!

737
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:45,010
It's big, isn't it, the Atlantic?
Think we should stop and ask someone?

738
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,846
Pishywibble, we're nearly there!

739
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:51,008
See, I take the North Star there...

740
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:54,519
...as a fixed point.
Then I plot my bearings from...

741
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,748
That's a plane, sir.

742
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:58,415
Insubordination.
I'll have you harpooned, elf.

743
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:00,754
I thought it would be chillier
near England.

744
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,157
Globular warming.

745
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:06,763
Land ahoy! There it is. Told you!

746
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:13,337
- There you are. Down.
- Watch that rock!

747
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:14,632
There you go.

748
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:22,544
England.

749
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,054
Maybe we pulled to the right a bit.
We're a reindeer short.

750
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,314
France.

751
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:35,227
They have elephants in France?

752
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:39,059
The odd stray. They breed in the drains.
This way.

753
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,468
Paris Zoo.

754
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:51,238
Then this is...

755
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:52,708
...where they keep the lions!

756
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,313
They won't eat me.

757
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:57,676
I'm Santa!

758
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,717
Lie down!

759
00:42:58,875 --> 00:42:59,546
Oh, right.

760
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:00,744
Call the keeper!

761
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:01,684
How old is this?

762
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:02,653
"Atlantis"?

763
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:04,416
"Here be cannibals"?

764
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:05,855
Watch out for cannibals.

765
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,754
This isn't France, is it?

766
00:43:09,986 --> 00:43:11,556
Technically, it's known as Africa.

767
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,826
Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.

768
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,560
How can you possibly be sure?

769
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:16,829
The GPS on my HOHO.

770
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,097
Take her!

771
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,235
Take the elf!

772
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,898
GPS? Why didn't you say?

773
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:25,342
I'm a wrapping elf. I don't navigate,
I wrap. I use it to store pictures of bows.

774
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:29,882
She's right. You brought us to Africa!
I've seen it on a stamp.

775
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,580
I'm too young to die, Arthur.

776
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:36,621
Do something. Arthur!

777
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,723
The old sleigh.
What is happening here?

778
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,529
Was supposed to be chopped up
for firewood decades ago.

779
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,694
- How did that devious--?
- Old people, sir.

780
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,306
Shall I get you your stress ball?

781
00:43:53,496 --> 00:43:54,531
We have finer...

782
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,769
...comms than the Pentagon,
and you say...

783
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:59,277
...we can't contact him
except by some ancient--

784
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:03,445
Here comes the cavalry!

785
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,484
Ernie Clicker, sir.

786
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:10,716
Head of Polar Communications
for 46 missions!

787
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,917
Oh, crikey blikey...

788
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,825
...me and your granddad
saw some times!

789
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:19,660
- I remember once--
- Wow, must catch up soon. Now...

790
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:24,433
Oh, you're in a hurry. I can tell.

791
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:31,640
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Could we hurry this?

792
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:35,107
You can't rush the Signalator.

793
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,149
Got to play her gentle.

794
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:41,150
So, what do you wish to say?

795
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:45,793
I wouldn't worry. It's not like
they're facing man-eating lions.

796
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:51,827
Silent night
Holy night

797
00:44:54,924 --> 00:44:56,767
All is calm

798
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,503
All is

799
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:01,768
Bright

800
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:03,772
I realize

801
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:06,209
This is mental
But it's all

802
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,449
That I know

803
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:11,846
It's Christmas

804
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:13,385
Nice kitty

805
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:16,182
So please let us go

806
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,327
Sleep in

807
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:24,022
Heavenly peace

808
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,495
Sleep in

809
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:30,866
Heavenly peace

810
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:42,509
Dash!

811
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:48,549
Something's coming through.

812
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,157
What does it say?

813
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:56,663
Get off! No!

814
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,356
That's me Evie, you mangy moron!

815
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:01,194
No!

816
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,530
That's Gwen's gift!

817
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:06,772
Only children get to tear the wrapping.

818
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,874
Bryony?

819
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,739
- Automatic tape guns!
- Down, doggy!

820
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,004
Bad doggy!

821
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:13,738
Laser-guided scissors!

822
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:16,841
Oh, no, no!

823
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,149
Standard-issue giftwrap!

824
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:21,083
No time for a bow!

825
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:23,053
There's always time for a bow!

826
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:25,152
I can't look.

827
00:46:27,283 --> 00:46:28,159
Not that knob!

828
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:29,256
Good night!

829
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:30,591
Oh, no!

830
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:32,856
Something else!

831
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,700
No, leave it! Don't--

832
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,568
My camera!

833
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:52,976
Wait! Look!

834
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:56,750
Oi!

835
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:31,851
What's so funny?

836
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:34,023
Look what they've done to my Evie.

837
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,196
- And the map.
- But it's okay.

838
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:38,457
We've got this. Look!

839
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:41,124
Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.

840
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,998
Proceed to the highlighted route.

841
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:45,105
What's the point? Look at us.

842
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:47,104
And my camera, totally banjaxed.

843
00:47:47,263 --> 00:47:49,334
How do I get my picture now?

844
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:50,636
What picture?

845
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,303
The sleigh on the roof,
the eight beautiful reindeer...

846
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,710
...and Santa-- Me!

847
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,646
--Going down the "chimbley."

848
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,983
That's what I wanted them to see.

849
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,749
They missed the kid, but I got there.
My way.

850
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:08,295
That's why you came. Not for Gwen.

851
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:13,357
1368 miles, then slight left.

852
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,637
For the love of Lulu...

853
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,273
...bossed about by Tinpot Tom.

854
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:20,333
Dash!

855
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:23,705
Try them again. Keep trying.

856
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,370
All this for one child. In 600 million.

857
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,538
We should turn her off a mo.

858
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,412
Don't worry, sir. Children are...

859
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:32,814
...stupid. Either it won't know
it got missed...

860
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,582
...or it'll think it's been bad.
It's a win-win.

861
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:37,553
You missed one?

862
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:39,057
A nipper? Cor!

863
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:43,059
What's all this here for
if you miss one?

864
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:45,061
Could you please type faster?

865
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:46,865
All right.

866
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:49,894
Systems critical.

867
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:50,901
Lead in Christmas.

868
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,211
Oops-a-daisy.

869
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,677
Peter...

870
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,911
...let go of my hand, please.

871
00:49:03,072 --> 00:49:04,881
Yes, sir. Sony, sir.

872
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,415
And get me IT.

873
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:12,949
Descend 1000 feet.

874
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:18,464
- You are at your destination.
- Yes!

875
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:20,328
- We did it, We did it!
- We did it!

876
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:24,134
In 100 yards...

877
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,336
turn left.

878
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:29,034
Straight ahead, left, right.
You are at your client's dwelling.

879
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:30,040
Hey, steady!

880
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,613
We made it. I survived!

881
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:44,080
I'll walk home, I'll get a boat,
but I am never getting back...

882
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:47,990
...in that crazy flying death trap
ever again!

883
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:50,489
Go on.

884
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,297
Get it over.

885
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:53,763
I want my bed.

886
00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:56,498
What, you're not coming?

887
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:01,369
You have to deliver the present.

888
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,740
You've got your special coat on.

889
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:05,412
You're our Santa.

890
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:08,640
I said me and Evie could get here,
and we did.

891
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,149
The rest is just elf work.

892
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:13,412
Go on, Festive Freddie...

893
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:14,919
...sling your hook.

894
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:20,959
It doesn't matter how we got here.

895
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:25,657
The sleigh on the roof, the jingle bells,
the eight reindeer.

896
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,459
Gwen would never have seen that.

897
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,183
I wish Dad could see this.

898
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,323
It would take such a load off his mind.

899
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,622
So, what are your orders?

900
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:59,331
You're a Claus. You give the orders.

901
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,695
Do I?

902
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,670
I'm just happy being an elf, really.
You know, just pan of it all.

903
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,537
You want to order me
to go through the cat flap?

904
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:11,805
Yes, that's a great idea.

905
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:15,875
Do you want to tell me to let you in?

906
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,950
Brilliant. Thank you, Bryony.

907
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,214
And do you want to--?

908
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:23,823
- Quick!
- The alarm? Definitely, yes.

909
00:51:56,479 --> 00:51:57,253
Is this...

910
00:51:57,413 --> 00:51:58,619
...your first time?

911
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:19,907
But--

912
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,080
Bryony?

913
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:36,723
Sony.

914
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:39,662
He likes these slippers
even more than you do!

915
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:48,274
Happy Christmas.

916
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,907
When you put the address into...

917
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,445
...the HOHO, what did you see?

918
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,311
A list of Trelews.
I just clicked on the first one!

919
00:52:56,472 --> 00:52:59,078
Which was not Trelew, England.

920
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,313
We're in the wrong Trelew!

921
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:08,795
What's going on?!

922
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,657
They've been watching us.
They've seen Evie.

923
00:53:13,055 --> 00:53:15,934
- It's just like last time.
- Governments tonight...

924
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,369
...are waking to news of a UFO
traveling the globe at incredible speed.

925
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:20,802
- That's us!
- The clearest...

926
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:23,136
...sighting was at
this tractor dealership...

927
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:25,210
-...in Idaho.
- Had eyeballs on its feet...

928
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:29,009
...and a pointy little head.
It asked me for a sign.

929
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,481
- We're on the news.
- From the trail in Toronto...

930
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,520
-...these beings do not appear friendly.
- Rebooting.

931
00:53:35,511 --> 00:53:37,013
- We are online, sir.
- This is...

932
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,318
Charlotte. Mexican...

933
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,619
police found a furry thing...

934
00:53:39,782 --> 00:53:41,659
-...trying to mate with a dog.
- I have calls...

935
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:45,391
-...reporting a steam train flying around.
- Steam train? Been on the eggnog?

936
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:48,194
It's gone black over Mexico.
This thing's going faster...

937
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:49,734
...than anything we know of.

938
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:51,803
- No.
- The herd is now in...

939
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:54,635
Mozambique's airspace,
threatening the fragile peace...

940
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:56,037
...between the two nations.

941
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:59,645
Two billion items delivered, and we
didn't leave a footprint in the snow.

942
00:53:59,802 --> 00:54:00,974
- And now--
- Sir?

943
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,708
We have lost 80 percent of our data.

944
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:05,681
No, no. We have 18 pulse...

945
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:10,188
-...data reservoirs of a trillion terabytes!
- Sorry, autosave was off.

946
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:12,053
Shall I slap him, sir? Quite hard?

947
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:12,886
Sir...

948
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:15,325
...there's a polar bear on Level 6.

949
00:54:15,484 --> 00:54:17,395
Sir? Why is Arthur out there?

950
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:19,893
He missed one.

951
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,126
A nipper.

952
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:22,727
I mean..

953
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,270
...47785BXK.

954
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,439
Sir, we've got something.

955
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:33,170
Bryony Shelfley, it's her HOHO.

956
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,182
We can still get there.

957
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,687
- We just have to go faster, higher!
- You've changed your tune.

958
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:43,721
I'm not going anywhere.

959
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,255
I'm not here!

960
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:47,888
I've taped myself in! Grandsanta!

961
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,356
Leave me. It's that...

962
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:51,122
...terrible night all over again.

963
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,231
What night?

964
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:53,958
Last time I took Evie for a spin.

965
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,130
I didn't know...

966
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:59,103
...it was the Cuban missile crisis!
I nearly started World War III.

967
00:55:01,163 --> 00:55:02,972
Hold still. Someone has to drive.

968
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:06,807
Oh, no!

969
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:07,741
Fencer!

970
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:08,974
Mincer! Come back!

971
00:55:10,706 --> 00:55:11,377
Bryony!

972
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:17,587
Grandsanta...

973
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:18,418
---get here!

974
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,061
Oi! That's me new hip.

975
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:23,992
Please, I'll read you Gwen's letter.

976
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:26,496
Stone-deaf. I'm 136.

977
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:28,464
- What's that?
- It's Steve.

978
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:29,728
- Steve!
- Tell him...

979
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:30,734
...l'm not here!

980
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:33,134
Grandsanta says he's not here.

981
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,072
Hi. I'm looking for a missing relic.

982
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,734
Steve, three words.

983
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,402
- Is the first one "help"?
- Yes.

984
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:41,241
- You can help us, Steve!
- It was him!

985
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,509
Frosty the Madman.
He forced me to come.

986
00:55:43,706 --> 00:55:45,447
Elf, back me up if you want a career.

987
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,918
- I forced you?
- You see? Look.

988
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:50,421
What did you want, Grandsanta?
Let me guess.

989
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:53,185
A picture of you in the sleigh
delivering the gift...

990
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,454
...to show me how it's really done?

991
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,289
No.

992
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:58,454
You know the picture
they'll have tomorrow?

993
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,328
You, led away in handcuffs!

994
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:03,493
The Santa who was seen.
By everybody on Earth.

995
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:05,672
The Santa who ruined Christmas.

996
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:06,772
Ruined it!

997
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:11,002
We'll fix this, Steve. We'll be back home
in the wobble of a reindeer's buttocks.

998
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:15,013
And Evie can go back in mothballs.
You can forget she ever existed.

999
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:18,175
You can't just go home.
What about Gwen?

1000
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,322
Gwen. For that, you'd threaten
my whole operation?

1001
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:24,788
Steve, you said if there was any way
to get there, you would.

1002
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:26,483
Well, this is it. Look.

1003
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,992
The old sleigh is perfect!

1004
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:32,493
Right. Well, anyway, it goes really fast,
even with bits missing.

1005
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,726
And we've got quite a few
reindeer left.

1006
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,564
And, if I'm sick again,
I could be sick in a bag.

1007
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,330
I'll wrap him one.

1008
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:40,839
We can help them.

1009
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,135
No one missed, sir!

1010
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:44,175
All correct presents,
present and correct.

1011
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:47,013
If you help us, Steve...

1012
00:56:47,169 --> 00:56:48,477
...we can do it!

1013
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,146
Grandsanta and Arthur would be...

1014
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,484
...the heroes of the night, sir!

1015
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:01,891
Come home now!

1016
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:03,591
If we all just gave in...

1017
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:05,732
...to Christmas spirit, there'd be chaos.

1018
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,298
- We're on our way, Steve.
- No!

1019
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,737
Santa will want us to get to Gwen.

1020
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:12,930
Ask him. Please.

1021
00:57:13,095 --> 00:57:14,165
Arthur...

1022
00:57:15,097 --> 00:57:17,577
...this is Dad we're talking about.

1023
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:21,579
There was a time when he cared about
every last gift tag, but now...

1024
00:57:21,737 --> 00:57:24,946
...he just wants to be loved
and get some rest.

1025
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:30,585
No. He's lying awake,
worrying his beard off about Gwen.

1026
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:34,859
Off to the land of nod.

1027
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:37,955
Please do not disturb
until December 26th.

1028
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,292
- Is that it, dear?
- Yes-

1029
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:40,525
Press the red--

1030
00:57:42,591 --> 00:57:43,626
No.

1031
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,866
Santa's the most caring man
in the world.

1032
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:50,602
So why are you here, not him?

1033
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:15,663
Don't leave me, Arthur!

1034
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:20,135
Poor old man and his reindeer,
on our own at Christmas?

1035
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,509
At least have the decency
to finish us off with a rock!

1036
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:01,710
Poor Evie.

1037
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:07,053
Sun'll be up soon.

1038
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:09,120
It's Christmas!

1039
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,023
Christmas is for kids.
You grow out of it.

1040
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,855
What, in the last six minutes?

1041
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:18,660
I know what you all say about me,
you know.

1042
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:22,630
"He belongs in the South Pole."

1043
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:27,164
Dear Arthur, what a puzzle.

1044
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:30,434
Well, you were right.

1045
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,842
All that fuss over one kid.

1046
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,643
I was being ridiculous.

1047
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,049
This is nice.

1048
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:43,053
It's good to get away from it all,
you know.

1049
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,214
All the Christmas fuss.

1050
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:57,062
I'm sorry I messed things up, lad.

1051
00:59:57,526 --> 00:59:58,698
You see...

1052
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:02,536
...the night I last took Evie out...

1053
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:05,770
...when there was all that fuss...

1054
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:08,072
...your father came to me.

1055
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:09,910
I'll never forget it.

1056
01:00:10,072 --> 01:00:12,177
Couldn't look me in the eye.

1057
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:14,581
"Dad," he says.

1058
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:18,548
"Steve thinks it best
you don't fly again.

1059
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:22,623
We're scrapping the sleigh."

1060
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,691
Me own son...

1061
01:00:26,355 --> 01:00:29,302
...who used to sit where you sat,
looking up at me.

1062
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:35,570
I just wanted them to remember...

1063
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:37,938
...who I used to be.

1064
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:44,748
I was a bit like you, lad.
Keen as cranberry.

1065
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,251
So was your dad.

1066
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:49,822
You get old, that's all.

1067
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:52,891
Everything changes.

1068
01:00:53,048 --> 01:00:54,425
Does it?

1069
01:00:56,151 --> 01:01:00,759
How can I ever write another letter
saying that Santa cares?

1070
01:01:08,964 --> 01:01:10,568
Good night, Dad.

1071
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,045
Sleep well.

1072
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:25,684
Sir, we know you shouldn't believe
rumors, but we do.

1073
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,623
Is it true you missed a child?

1074
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:29,956
Me? No, no, no.

1075
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,565
Well, in a way, yes.

1076
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:35,663
It was just one.

1077
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:37,667
In fact, not even that.

1078
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:39,863
Naught point lots more naughts...

1079
01:01:40,062 --> 01:01:42,770
...then a number
and some son of percent at the end.

1080
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:46,208
Not really an error, just a one.

1081
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:49,008
One child doesn't matter? Which one?

1082
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:50,616
Well, I... It's not that--

1083
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:52,616
I did nine ones in Greece.

1084
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,345
- Did those matter?
- What about my ones...

1085
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,683
...in Germany? One of them was twins!

1086
01:01:56,845 --> 01:01:58,620
They don't matter half each.

1087
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:03,058
Why don't you ask Steve?
He can explain. Fiendishly clever.

1088
01:02:03,218 --> 01:02:05,323
But aren't you in charge, sir?

1089
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:09,358
Of course. I'm Santa.

1090
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:10,367
Sir...

1091
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,530
...if the one that got missed
doesn't matter...

1092
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,506
...why have Arthur and Grandsanta
gone to take it?

1093
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:21,612
- What?
- Malcolm, what's this about Arthur?

1094
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:24,707
He's crazy.

1095
01:02:24,873 --> 01:02:27,080
Is there a list of children
who don't matter?

1096
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:29,381
Santa said they don't matter
100 percent.

1097
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:32,424
Is it true children aren't real,
they're just antimatter?

1098
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:34,860
Do not-- Look. Look!

1099
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:38,692
I festivized every single country
in the world. You see?

1100
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:41,357
This one, this one, this one.
All of them.

1101
01:02:41,523 --> 01:02:44,732
I mean, who cares about
one single tiny child?

1102
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:49,734
I do.

1103
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,077
Arthur.

1104
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:54,439
My poor boy.

1105
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:56,580
Why on earth would he--?

1106
01:02:57,272 --> 01:03:00,742
You're his brother, Steve.
How could you let him?

1107
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,919
And about this child you missed...

1108
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,754
...l'm really not sure
you made the right decision.

1109
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,564
Is that bird doo on your shoulder?

1110
01:03:13,288 --> 01:03:14,528
Right.

1111
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,135
Over there is Satellite...

1112
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:18,771
...Tracking, Navigation, Data Analysis.

1113
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:22,932
Coffee machine's by the door.
Good night, Santa.

1114
01:03:35,944 --> 01:03:37,582
I'll be right back.

1115
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,196
Dear Xiao-Ling,
thanks for your letter...

1116
01:04:18,353 --> 01:04:20,594
...and drawing of Santa
tripping over your dog.

1117
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:21,791
It was hilarious.

1118
01:04:21,957 --> 01:04:22,935
Dear Alessandro...

1119
01:04:23,091 --> 01:04:27,198
...I'm sorry your family's
had a hard year, but Santa is real.

1120
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:31,708
Dear Lars, I promise Santa will come-

1121
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:34,473
He's the greatest man ever.

1122
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,495
- Can I burn this?
- Sure.

1123
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:58,268
There's millions like it.

1124
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:22,089
This picture.

1125
01:05:22,384 --> 01:05:24,557
This drawing!

1126
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,500
It isn't of Dad...

1127
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:29,199
...or you..

1128
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:31,099
...or Steve.

1129
01:05:33,328 --> 01:05:35,171
This is Santa!

1130
01:05:36,865 --> 01:05:42,213
And as long we get the bike to Gwen
before she wakes up, then Santa came!

1131
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,942
And he cares!

1132
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:52,385
Excuse!

1133
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,221
Jingle bells, jingle bells

1134
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:55,953
Jingle all the way

1135
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,426
Oh, what fun it is to reach

1136
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:59,065
Gwen Hines on Christmas Day

1137
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,403
Jingle Bells
This boat smells

1138
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,971
Three thousand miles to go

1139
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,339
Oh, dear.

1140
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:14,442
I've seen this before.
Sleigh fever, they call it.

1141
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:17,482
Pressure of Christmas
sends a man doolally-tap.

1142
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:20,586
Santa Claus XVI got it, 1802.

1143
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:23,746
Every child that year got a sausage
nailed to a piece of bark.

1144
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:30,155
Arthur, do you really think you can
row the Atlantic Ocean in the next...

1145
01:06:30,352 --> 01:06:31,990
-...37 minutes?
- It's not...

1146
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:35,159
...too late yet.

1147
01:06:35,357 --> 01:06:38,497
I just have to keep going.

1148
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:42,107
We need a blunt instrument.
Knock him out and regroup.

1149
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:47,077
Make a legal U-turn,
then slight right in 4228 miles.

1150
01:06:47,235 --> 01:06:49,647
You do know
we're going round in circles?

1151
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:55,244
You know, we're not the only ones.
Maybe I will see Evie again.

1152
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,251
- What do you mean?
- Reindeer are...

1153
01:06:57,412 --> 01:06:58,982
...brave, powerful beasts...

1154
01:06:59,147 --> 01:07:02,287
...but they're also dappled cretins
with twigs on their heads.

1155
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:06,957
They'll just keep going in a straight line
right round the world.

1156
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,499
They'll be way up in the sky, flying...

1157
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,195
...at unimaginable speed,
but they'll pass...

1158
01:07:12,394 --> 01:07:14,374
-...right over our heads.
- Great!

1159
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:16,270
We can get the sleigh back!

1160
01:07:20,268 --> 01:07:21,338
- Chief De Silva.
- Where is...

1161
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:24,507
-...this UFO?
- It's circling the Earth, ma'am.

1162
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,313
Nineteen minutes ago,
it went into orbit.

1163
01:07:28,143 --> 01:07:31,647
You? Up there? Catch that with this?

1164
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:33,649
Magic dust.

1165
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:35,351
You crack it over your head.

1166
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:39,465
You'll have to focus. The sleigh'll be
coming at you at 45,000 miles an hour.

1167
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:41,362
-45,000--?
- You'll be torn...

1168
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:42,558
...in half!

1169
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:46,194
Depends on the angle the sleigh hits
You might just get beheaded.

1170
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:51,640
I've got a phobia of being beheaded,
and heights and speed and reindeer...

1171
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,870
...and buttons.

1172
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,170
Buttons?

1173
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,316
Yeah, I'm pretty much scared
of everything.

1174
01:07:56,471 --> 01:07:58,974
Gwen thinks you're coming.

1175
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:01,310
You can't do this. Yes, you can!

1176
01:08:01,476 --> 01:08:03,979
No, you can't. Yes, you can!
Come on, Arthur!

1177
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,921
Don't worry. Only a raving lunatic--

1178
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:09,062
I have to worry!
It's the only thing I'm good at!

1179
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:10,753
Worry me.

1180
01:08:10,952 --> 01:08:12,556
The sleigh'll be back any minute.

1181
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:14,359
Come on. Worry me, quickly!

1182
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:17,927
Imagine Gwen, all alone...

1183
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:20,596
-...nothing under the tree.
- Here we go.

1184
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:24,442
No! Don't like this! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Get me down!

1185
01:08:24,599 --> 01:08:26,704
The tears as she finds
she's been left out.

1186
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:28,939
Screaming, "Santa didn't come!"

1187
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:30,105
Oh, Gwen.

1188
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,081
No! It's just...

1189
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,379
-...too high!
- Gwen in the street...

1190
01:08:34,576 --> 01:08:36,681
...surrounded by kids
on new bikes, pointing:

1191
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,923
"That's the girl that Santa hates!"

1192
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:44,224
She runs away, alcoholic by the age
of 9. Dead before she's even--!

1193
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,992
She may never build
a snowman again!

1194
01:08:48,356 --> 01:08:51,394
What if there are buttons on the sleigh
I don't know about?!

1195
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:53,595
Here it is!

1196
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,788
How do you think he's...?

1197
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,295
Fine, fine. Probably just...

1198
01:09:32,934 --> 01:09:36,279
So how come they didn't
scrap the sleigh, sir?

1199
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:40,352
I threatened the elves.
Said I'd feed them to the polar bears.

1200
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,869
Elf, how do you fancy being the one
to tell his parents about all this?

1201
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,161
Arthur!

1202
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:34,204
- You did it!
- I did it with worry!

1203
01:10:34,362 --> 01:10:36,899
Oh, I was sure you'd die. It was great!

1204
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,078
Proceed to the highlighted route.

1205
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,043
Proceed to the highlighted...

1206
01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:44,881
Just keep worrying about Gwen.

1207
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,146
I'll find a way there, boy.
Whatever it takes.

1208
01:10:48,543 --> 01:10:50,250
To Trelew!

1209
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:54,991
Margaret.

1210
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,027
Hand me my Me suit.

1211
01:10:57,185 --> 01:10:58,858
All sorted. Steve's...

1212
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,260
...holding the font...

1213
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,232
...while I deliver the present, yes...

1214
01:11:03,391 --> 01:11:05,200
...and find Arthur and Father.

1215
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,597
Well done, dear.

1216
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:10,504
Trelew's on a course of 187.7 degrees
from the geographic pole...

1217
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:12,372
...but as it's the old sleigh...

1218
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:15,174
...allow a drift margin
of 1000 miles either side...

1219
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:17,681
...of the meridian.
Got a sweater for Arthur...

1220
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:19,011
...your father's pills...

1221
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:21,051
...and some nice sweet tea.

1222
01:11:27,515 --> 01:11:28,653
Curtains.

1223
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,290
- S-1 dented.
- Sir. Sir!

1224
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,126
Big scratch...

1225
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:35,233
...down side.

1226
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:37,666
"Popped out to take present.

1227
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:39,939
Turkey sandwich in fridge.
Mum and Dad."

1228
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,438
Espresso machine broken.

1229
01:11:41,596 --> 01:11:43,906
That idiot, Arthur. He's sent...

1230
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:45,544
...everyone crazy.

1231
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,043
He'll destroy Christmas.

1232
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,705
And you'll never get to be Santa.

1233
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,885
Steven!

1234
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:57,914
23 Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.

1235
01:11:58,813 --> 01:11:59,484
Malcolm...

1236
01:11:59,681 --> 01:12:01,957
...there's no harm in using a manual.

1237
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:04,893
- Men.
- Margaret, I order you to disembark.

1238
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:06,327
It's not safe.

1239
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:09,560
Piffle. I did a microlight flying course
on the Internet.

1240
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:11,635
It can't be that different.

1241
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:14,463
Steve.

1242
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:18,243
You've dented it!
You take it out without asking?

1243
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,243
Malcolm, you told me he knew.

1244
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,439
You know how Steve feels
about his S-1 .

1245
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:25,016
It's my S-1 . S for "Santa."

1246
01:12:25,206 --> 01:12:27,186
I'm flying to this child.

1247
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:30,812
Of course she's all that matters.
Not me, your son.

1248
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:34,620
Not the 2 billion things
I did right tonight. No!

1249
01:12:35,717 --> 01:12:37,993
This is about that pool table, isn't it?

1250
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,861
I told you, you should've written to me.

1251
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:43,332
I was 8. You're my dad!

1252
01:12:43,491 --> 01:12:44,526
For goodness sake!

1253
01:12:44,726 --> 01:12:46,637
Arthur and Grandsanta are out there...

1254
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,968
...probably not wearing
nearly enough layers...

1255
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:51,974
...and you two are bickering over
a big red toy?!

1256
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:54,113
I'm not bickering.
If Steven could just...

1257
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:54,940
...stand back--

1258
01:12:55,503 --> 01:12:56,811
Air bag.

1259
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:05,155
You drive, Steven.

1260
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:06,815
Thank you.

1261
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:10,657
So since gift delivery
to child 47785BXK...

1262
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,162
...is all that seems...

1263
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,799
...to matter...

1264
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:15,059
I'll do it myself.

1265
01:13:15,256 --> 01:13:18,897
Then we'll pick up Arthur and Grandsanta
from whatever ditch they ended up in.

1266
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,571
Maximum thrust.

1267
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,508
When Santa said he'd be right back...

1268
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,479
...what do you think he--?

1269
01:13:30,638 --> 01:13:32,584
He's not coming back!

1270
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:34,185
The Santas are leaving!

1271
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:35,377
Children don't matter?

1272
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:36,920
Christmas doesn't matter!

1273
01:13:37,078 --> 01:13:37,852
Nothing matters!

1274
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,687
It's like 1816!

1275
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:41,725
Abandon the North Pole!

1276
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:43,920
- Everybody, panic!
- Are you sure you want...

1277
01:13:44,085 --> 01:13:45,359
...to delete Christmas?

1278
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,325
Meltdown: 10 minutes.

1279
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:50,024
- Head south!
- It's all south from here, you fool!

1280
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,101
I know where we can find...

1281
01:13:54,295 --> 01:13:55,296
“a map, mu

1282
01:13:57,165 --> 01:13:57,836
A bit...

1283
01:13:57,999 --> 01:13:58,670
...risky, this.

1284
01:14:00,935 --> 01:14:03,541
Breaking the rules,
even in the old days.

1285
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,736
There!

1286
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:28,407
Biggest map in the world!

1287
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,102
Dash!

1288
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:40,117
Friends, on this night of peace,
we stand confronted...

1289
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:41,948
...by an unknown danger.

1290
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,284
Aliens. Aliens from space.

1291
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,120
- Blast them from the skies!
- Let us do an autopsy.

1292
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:50,422
But maybe the aliens come in peace?

1293
01:14:50,585 --> 01:14:51,563
They burst an inflatable...

1294
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:54,165
...Santa Claus in Toronto.
On Christmas night!

1295
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:56,892
- What a terrible thing.
- Let us attempt contact...

1296
01:14:57,125 --> 01:15:00,231
...but be ready to save our planet.

1297
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:04,800
Hold tight, lad. This is where it gets...

1298
01:15:04,966 --> 01:15:06,001
...really rough.

1299
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,290
Not now...

1300
01:15:20,448 --> 01:15:21,654
...you sack of antlers.

1301
01:15:31,092 --> 01:15:32,264
Alert level six.

1302
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:34,338
It's coming down through
the atmosphere.

1303
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:35,474
We'll see it.

1304
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:36,973
Forty-six, 45...

1305
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:39,634
...44, 43...

1306
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:42,838
They'll be waiting for us, sir.
We were on the news.

1307
01:15:43,004 --> 01:15:46,884
All their technology against my Evie.

1308
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,817
Oh, come on. Let's do it with worry!

1309
01:15:51,012 --> 01:15:53,822
Santa mustn't be seen, eh, lad?

1310
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,222
Let's give them...

1311
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:56,554
...something to shoot at.

1312
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:58,957
We have visual.

1313
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,292
Here it comes.

1314
01:16:02,223 --> 01:16:04,032
Take us to your leader.

1315
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,168
England!

1316
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:08,369
No sign of anyone.

1317
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:11,136
- The sun's coming up!
- Come on, lad! You can...

1318
01:16:11,299 --> 01:16:12,676
...do it! Move your hooves!

1319
01:16:13,234 --> 01:16:15,180
Mankind greets you. Do you copy?

1320
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:18,214
Season's greetings from mankind.
Good morning, do you copy?

1321
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:20,646
The hull is some kind of
woody substance, ma'am.

1322
01:16:20,808 --> 01:16:22,344
Like wood.

1323
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,387
Coated in lead paint.

1324
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:25,889
The engine seems to be alive.

1325
01:16:26,047 --> 01:16:27,720
And furry.

1326
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,685
Come on, lad!

1327
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,057
Put your back...

1328
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:31,890
...into it!

1329
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:43,241
I have something. It's very faint but--

1330
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:44,342
Scramble drone.

1331
01:16:47,602 --> 01:16:49,172
That's it, there!

1332
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:50,509
We made it!

1333
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:54,277
Not quite.

1334
01:16:54,475 --> 01:16:55,180
Dash!

1335
01:16:58,613 --> 01:17:00,615
It's right up me steam pipe!

1336
01:17:01,115 --> 01:17:04,392
- It's tracking something electronic!
- We haven't got...

1337
01:17:04,552 --> 01:17:06,691
...any "electrickery." Just wood...

1338
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:07,923
...and brass and--

1339
01:17:08,089 --> 01:17:09,193
Oh, dear.

1340
01:17:09,357 --> 01:17:11,030
- Your slipper!
- Your slipper!

1341
01:17:11,759 --> 01:17:12,760
We have lock.

1342
01:17:13,394 --> 01:17:15,067
We got to get you down there, lad.

1343
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,506
- They'll see us! We'll be stopped!
- Give me that.

1344
01:17:17,999 --> 01:17:20,912
- What are you doing?
- It's Evie they're after.

1345
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:24,949
She doesn't fit this world, Arthur
She's a relic.

1346
01:17:25,106 --> 01:17:25,914
Evie?

1347
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:30,045
I always knew she'd be needed
one more time.

1348
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:33,424
You go on. We'll let them have her.

1349
01:17:33,581 --> 01:17:34,992
You're coming too.

1350
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:39,894
You were right, Arthur. It doesn't matter
how Santa's gift gets there.

1351
01:17:40,054 --> 01:17:42,125
Doesn't even matter if it's...

1352
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:45,737
-...Mr. Postman in his spaceship.
- As long as it gets there.

1353
01:17:45,893 --> 01:17:49,534
You made it happen, lad.
No one got left out.

1354
01:17:49,797 --> 01:17:51,140
Get off.

1355
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,676
Now, do as I say.

1356
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:54,669
They're firing on us!

1357
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,679
- A death ray!
- Made of chocolate...

1358
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,909
...and oranges.
- Unidentified...

1359
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:00,177
...varnished object...

1360
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:01,649
...turn back or we shoot.

1361
01:18:01,809 --> 01:18:02,549
Go!

1362
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:04,312
Turn back.

1363
01:18:06,547 --> 01:18:08,584
Happy Christmas!

1364
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,060
In Santa we believe!

1365
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,091
Go on, elf.

1366
01:18:13,354 --> 01:18:14,765
You too.

1367
01:18:18,259 --> 01:18:19,863
Fire missiles.

1368
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:22,339
This is it, old fella.

1369
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:23,973
Maybe the next...

1370
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:26,544
...Santa never sat in my Evie...

1371
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:28,009
but Arthur did.

1372
01:18:28,169 --> 01:18:32,083
And he's as good a man
as any Santa there's ever been.

1373
01:18:38,212 --> 01:18:39,282
Goodbye, Evie.

1374
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,355
Thank you, everyone.

1375
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:48,899
You just saved Christmas.

1376
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:01,343
Trelew.

1377
01:19:05,473 --> 01:19:08,420
Out with the old, in with the new.

1378
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:10,723
Well done, dear.

1379
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:20,526
Poor Arthur. He tried so hard.

1380
01:19:20,888 --> 01:19:22,868
- He's flunked again.
- Of course...

1381
01:19:23,057 --> 01:19:24,195
...he hasn't, dear.

1382
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:28,068
We're here. The little girl
will get her present.

1383
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:31,073
I think he's done rather splendidly.

1384
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:34,237
My Margaret.

1385
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:39,941
Good morning, Gwen. Ho, ho, et cetera.

1386
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:41,711
Apologies for the minor delay.

1387
01:19:41,876 --> 01:19:44,083
I'm sure that even a child
can understand...

1388
01:19:44,245 --> 01:19:46,623
...that in an operation
as complex as Christmas...

1389
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:50,388
...there's always an insignificant
margin of error...

1390
01:19:50,551 --> 01:19:52,531
...which is you. As a gesture...

1391
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:56,430
...l've upgraded you
to the Glamorfast Ultra X-3...

1392
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:59,162
...which retails at 9.99 more
than your requested gift.

1393
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:02,569
Bigger ergo better.

1394
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:05,040
If you wouldn't mind
just signing a legal waiver?

1395
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:12,615
Pedro? A boy?

1396
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,453
A Spanish boy?

1397
01:20:17,178 --> 01:20:18,248
This is an error.

1398
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:21,789
Now get off the bike.

1399
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,087
Will you get--?

1400
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,197
No, no, no. Please don't cry.

1401
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:26,998
No cry-o.

1402
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:31,996
No "sob-idad. "

1403
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:40,635
It's over a mile.

1404
01:20:42,336 --> 01:20:45,317
We've got no sleigh, no reindeer,
and you can't even walk.

1405
01:20:47,575 --> 01:20:48,849
What are you doing?

1406
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:53,619
I can cycle!

1407
01:20:54,415 --> 01:20:55,860
Oi! Come back!

1408
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,156
What about the wrapping?!

1409
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:02,200
The church. She lives by the church!

1410
01:21:02,356 --> 01:21:04,632
Happy Christmas, cows!

1411
01:21:04,792 --> 01:21:08,262
Meltdown. Ten seconds
to figgy Flensburg. Snowman.

1412
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:11,000
German, leave out the carrot.
Is Santa on shoe?

1413
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:12,739
What the--?!

1414
01:21:14,235 --> 01:21:16,772
Look, everyone! It's Arthur!

1415
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,509
He's delivering the present.

1416
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,984
- It's Arthur.
- Hooray for Arthur!

1417
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,450
Meltdown paused.

1418
01:21:26,614 --> 01:21:27,854
Come back!

1419
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:32,388
Oh, my head.

1420
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:35,060
Ye baubles,
a beautiful young reindeer.

1421
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:37,696
So who am I, then?

1422
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,705
Okay, so I'm not great with children.

1423
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,139
Does that make me a bad Santa?

1424
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:46,738
You're hardly perfect.

1425
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:50,041
Let me guess. You put in the address,
you saw a list of Trelews...

1426
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:52,150
...and just clicked on the first one?

1427
01:21:52,306 --> 01:21:53,785
You're just like Arthur.

1428
01:21:54,842 --> 01:21:56,344
- Am I?
- North Pole...

1429
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:59,583
-...incoming.
- Sir, the soldiers have shot the sleigh.

1430
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:00,982
But, sir...

1431
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:03,856
...it's Arthur. He's still going.

1432
01:22:04,018 --> 01:22:06,521
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!

1433
01:22:07,655 --> 01:22:08,929
Arthur?

1434
01:22:11,492 --> 01:22:14,496
No one gets an unwrapped present
on my watch.

1435
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:19,044
Three bits of sticky tape.

1436
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,572
Three.

1437
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:22,712
Stand up!

1438
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:26,614
Finger!

1439
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:29,444
The church!

1440
01:22:34,515 --> 01:22:35,892
Right foot.

1441
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:38,561
Left foot.

1442
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:40,362
There it is!

1443
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,331
One!

1444
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:49,639
Hands up!

1445
01:22:59,473 --> 01:23:00,451
Arthur!

1446
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:03,054
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!

1447
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:03,915
Nearly there!

1448
01:23:06,113 --> 01:23:07,490
Front wheel!

1449
01:23:13,654 --> 01:23:14,758
“Two !
“Yes !

1450
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,098
That's it, there!

1451
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:21,371
Back wheel!

1452
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:24,270
- Ready?
- Do it!

1453
01:23:28,235 --> 01:23:29,612
Here we go!

1454
01:23:40,581 --> 01:23:41,525
Three!

1455
01:23:46,253 --> 01:23:47,698
Elf down.

1456
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,124
Bryony?

1457
01:23:49,323 --> 01:23:51,826
Go on, Arthur. Quick!

1458
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,964
There's always time for a bow.

1459
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:07,309
No, we can't be too late.

1460
01:24:31,298 --> 01:24:33,005
It's so unfair.

1461
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,378
Merry Christmas!

1462
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:47,355
All the Santas
taking the missing present.

1463
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:48,687
It's beautiful!

1464
01:24:48,849 --> 01:24:50,590
Hug me. Hug me.

1465
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:27,123
Dad!

1466
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:30,292
You came! I knew you would.

1467
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:33,131
You wouldn't just go to bed
and forget Gwen.

1468
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,409
You're Santa!

1469
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:44,610
Give me that.

1470
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,547
I'm Santa! I'm delivering it!

1471
01:25:46,707 --> 01:25:49,711
Don't be silly, I'm Santa.
Can't you see from me suit?

1472
01:25:49,877 --> 01:25:52,323
I am actually Santa,
and I think it would be best--

1473
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:54,322
I'm Santa! You handed over!

1474
01:25:54,515 --> 01:25:57,223
- I didn't, in fact, technically--
- You said I could drive!

1475
01:25:57,384 --> 01:26:00,831
I'm Santa, you naughty boys.
Here, have a bonbon.

1476
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:01,829
You--

1477
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:05,602
It's Christmas!

1478
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,903
Please.

1479
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:12,243
Gwen just has to have a present
from Santa.

1480
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:19,983
You do it, Arthur.

1481
01:26:21,942 --> 01:26:24,047
Mummy! Daddy! Wake up!

1482
01:26:35,856 --> 01:26:38,097
There's a ribbon! To downstairs!

1483
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:42,972
- Father, please keep it down.
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

1484
01:26:44,932 --> 01:26:45,603
Dad, wait.

1485
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:48,810
Please, let's...

1486
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:55,186
In all my years, I've never actually...

1487
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,490
Always so busy.

1488
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:03,960
Too busy.

1489
01:27:05,085 --> 01:27:06,860
I'm not good at...

1490
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:14,037
In my day, a pat on the back
and a walnut went a long way.

1491
01:27:14,995 --> 01:27:18,465
Mummy, Daddy, come on!
Look, a ribbon to downstairs!

1492
01:27:18,632 --> 01:27:21,078
- Come on, then.
- I think it's under the tree!

1493
01:27:21,235 --> 01:27:22,737
Oh, look!

1494
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:24,408
What is it?

1495
01:27:24,605 --> 01:27:26,346
I can see pink!

1496
01:27:27,608 --> 01:27:29,884
It's a bike!

1497
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:34,985
Santa brought me the bike I wanted!

1498
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,253
Did he?

1499
01:27:36,817 --> 01:27:39,730
Can I have a go?
Please, please, please?

1500
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:40,691
Steve...

1501
01:27:41,255 --> 01:27:43,496
you deserve to be Santa.

1502
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:52,711
But, Steve...

1503
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:57,748
...I wonder if Gwen is right.

1504
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:02,711
Watch out. Careful...

1505
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:04,379
...l'm gonna bump into you.

1506
01:28:08,849 --> 01:28:10,192
Oh, no.

1507
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:22,771
I'll be the candle, eh?

1508
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,742
You're better men than...

1509
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:37,821
Both of you.

1510
01:28:38,979 --> 01:28:41,255
A bike and...

1511
01:28:41,415 --> 01:28:42,826
...a squirrel!

1512
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,958
Drop complete.

1513
01:28:49,623 --> 01:28:52,001
And we have a new Santa!

1514
01:28:52,693 --> 01:28:54,434
Christmas accomplished.

1515
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:55,471
Arthur!

1516
01:28:55,896 --> 01:28:58,308
- Oh, Arthur.
- Commence...

1517
01:28:58,465 --> 01:28:59,944
...decking halls.

1518
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:04,310
You know, I've always liked Arthur.
Do you think he likes espresso?

1519
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:28,856
And may 100 percent
of your Christmases be white.
